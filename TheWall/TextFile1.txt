this is based entirely on the context and the circumstance. If we look at car consumption a half a century ago -- it could have been interpreted to be many people to one car, as many families had a single car. late in the 20th century, it was common that every working adult in suburban areas had a car -- so it would be one-to-one. Today in cities -- car sharing is popular, so int that context you could have many people to many cars. Then of course, there are the car enthusiates who collect cars and in that case -- it would be one person to many.
